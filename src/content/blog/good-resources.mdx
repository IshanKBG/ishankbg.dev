description: A compilation of amazing resources that I found useful in my learning journey.

This article is a compilation of useful resources that I used throughout my programming journey. This is a list of "things that worked for me" rather than "best resources available for you" and it also does not contain every single resources out there in the Internet.
I will continue to update the list with the resources that I find useful in the future.

# Courses

1. [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) is a fantastic course for beginners to learn the basics of computer science and programming in general. It will help you get started into the world of software development. This course is divided into several videos and each video comes with a set of interesting problems which you can solve to test your knowledge. This was the first course I ever watched to get started with computer science and programming.

2. [Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)Â is a fantastic course. This course will teach your own computer system from logic gates to a working operating system. This course is extremely fun for those who wants to learn about computers from scratch.

3. [The Missing Semester of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) will teach you the basics of the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of git and much more which many courses miss out while teaching different topics in CS.

4. [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) provides a really good curriculum  to get started with web development. If you are willing to learn web development then I recommend this course.
5. [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is a fantastic book that teaches you how to build a programming language from scratch. This book is a must-read for those who are interested in interpreters and compilers.
