While searching for a good markdown parser in Rust, I found the markdown-rs crate. It is a markdown parser written in Rust. It is a fast and efficient parser.
But why not use the `pulldown-cmark` crate? Because the `markdown-rs` crate is more feature-rich and has more options such as parsing MDX, frontmatter, and maths.
So let's start by installing the `markdown-rs` crate.
```sh
cargo add markdown@1.0.0-alpha.17
```
Now let's see how to parse markdown using the `markdown-rs` crate.
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), markdown::message::Message> {
    println!(
        "{}",
        markdown::to_html_with_options(
            "* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~",
            &markdown::Options::gfm(),
            
        )?
    );

    Ok(())
}
```
The above code compiles the markdown to html using the `to_html_with_options` function. The `Options::gfm()` function is used to enable GitHub Flavored Markdown.
It is just a simple example. But you can do a lot more complex things with the `markdown-rs` crate such as parsing MDX or even creating your own flavour. Here [checkout](https://docs.rs/markdown/1.0.0-alpha.17/markdown/struct.Options.html) the API documentation of the `markdown-rs` crate.
