<Layout title="About" description="About me and this blog">
My name is **Ishan Jaiswal**, though I sometimes use the handle _**ishankbg**_ online.
I'm a student and part-time computer programmer from India and I love to create unique and innovative softwares.
I'm currently working at [ReMod Limited](remod.dev) on various projects. My work and side projects mostly involve working on applications at low level using Rust and C
but I sometimes also work with backend using Go and Typescript.
I'm also a huge fan of open-source software and I try to contribute to the community whenever I can.
I created this blog to share my thoughts, experiences and knowledge with the world.

In general I try to create content that is both helpful and unique.
This blog is completely open-source and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/IshanKBG/ishankbg.dev).
If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me on my [email](mailto:contact@ishankbg.dev)
